          COVID-19 is growing across Canadaâ€™s provinces and territories. It
          represents the average number of people who become infected by an
          infectious person. If <Rt /> is above 1.0, the virus will spread
          quickly. When <Rt /> is below 1.0, the virus will stop spreading.
